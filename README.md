# Coding Catas

This repo is where I keep coding Katas and examples. Each directory contains a different Kata or example.

There's not much here at the moment, but I'd like to keep adding more here as and when I create it.

Please feel free to use and distribute anything in this repo that is mine as you wish. If you do - a citation would be much appreciated. I'd love to hear what you're doing with it too - hit me up [on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/RankineSimon).
